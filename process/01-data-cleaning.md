## Actions Performed
- Use a Excel CSV file 
- Renamed columns for clarity and consistency
- Standardized expiration date formats
- Removed blank and non-actionable records
- Validated classification and status fields
- Ensured each key record could be uniquely tracked

## Outcome
A clean dataset that supports deterministic expiration calculations, risk categorization, and automated alerting.
